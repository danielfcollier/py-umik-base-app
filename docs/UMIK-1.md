## 1. What is the UMIK-1?

The **miniDSP UMIK-1** is a specialized omnidirectional USB measurement microphone. Unlike microphones designed for voice or music, its primary purpose is to provide a scientifically accurate, linear, and repeatable way to capture sound.

### Key Features:

* **Plug-and-Play:** It is a UAC-1 (USB Audio Class 1) compliant device, meaning it requires no special drivers for any major operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, Raspberry Pi OS). The system recognizes it as a standard USB microphone.
* **Flat Frequency Response:** It is engineered to capture all audible frequencies (typically 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz) with as little deviation as possible.
* **Unique, Individual Calibration:** This is its most important feature. Every single UMIK-1 is tested at the factory, and a unique calibration file is generated based on its specific serial number. This file provides the exact frequency response correction data for that individual unit.
* **Omnidirectional Polar Pattern:** It captures sound equally from all directions, making it ideal for measuring the overall acoustic environment of a room.

## 2. Relevance for Your Sound Monitoring Application

Using a calibrated microphone like the UMIK-1 is the difference between building a simple "volume detector" and a true **acoustic monitoring instrument**.

The principle is simple: **Garbage In, Garbage Out.** The quality of your analysis is fundamentally limited by the quality of your input data.

* **Uncalibrated Microphones (Laptops, Phones):** These are "colored." They are designed to boost the frequencies of human speech and cut low-frequency rumble. When you feed this biased signal into your application:
    * **LUFS measurements will be inaccurate**, as they will be calculated on an already altered signal.
    * **Low-frequency environmental noise** (like traffic rumble, HVAC hum, typically 20Hz-250Hz) will be severely underestimated or missed entirely. This is because these microphones are physically small and often electronically filtered to prioritize speech clarity.
    * The YAMNet model receives a distorted version of reality, which can reduce its classification accuracy.

* **Calibrated UMIK-1:** This provides a "ground truth" signal.
    * It ensures that a sound's energy is represented accurately across the entire frequency spectrum, **including critical low frequencies**.
    * This allows metrics like **LUFS** and **dBSPL** to be calculated with scientific accuracy, making your alerts and historical data meaningful and comparable.
    * It provides the machine learning model with a clean, unbiased signal, leading to more reliable classification.

In short, for your application to produce trustworthy data, a calibrated input is not just a feature—it's a requirement.

## 3. The Real-Time Calibration Process

Calibration is not a hardware setting. It is a **continuous, real-time software process** that corrects the audio signal as it comes in. Your Python program is responsible for this.

The process has three phases:

### Phase 1: One-Time Setup (Manual)

1.  **Find Serial Number:** Locate the 7-digit serial number printed on the body of your UMIK-1.
2.  **Download File:** Go to the miniDSP calibration tool website (linked above) and enter your serial number to download your unique calibration `.txt` file. Choose the "0-degree" file (`_0_degree.txt`) for direct sound measurement.

### Phase 2: Application Startup (Filter Design & Caching)

This happens once, every time your `noise_monitor` app starts.

1.  **Check for Cache:** Your `Calibrator` class first looks for a pre-computed filter file (e.g., `audio/device/calibrator/fir_filter_taps.npy`).
2.  **Load from Cache (Fast Path):** If the cache file exists, the calibrator loads the filter coefficients directly from it, skipping the expensive design step. This makes your application start almost instantly on subsequent runs.
3.  **Design Filter (First Run):** If no cache is found, the `Calibrator` performs these steps:
    * It reads the frequencies and gain values from your calibration `.txt` file.
    * It uses this data to design a digital **FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter** using `scipy.signal.firwin2`. This filter is mathematically designed to apply the *exact inverse* of your microphone's unique frequency response. The default number of coefficients ("taps") is often set high (e.g., 1023) for accuracy.
    * It saves the resulting filter coefficients (the "taps") to the cache file for future runs.

### Phase 3: Real-Time Correction (Continuous Loop)

This is the core of the process and happens inside your consumer thread for every single audio chunk.

1.  **Receive Raw Audio:** The thread gets a raw, uncalibrated audio chunk from the input queue.
2.  **Apply Filter:** It immediately passes this raw chunk to the `audio_device_calibrator.apply()` method. This method uses `scipy.signal.lfilter` to perform a mathematical convolution between the audio data and the filter coefficients designed at startup. This step is computationally intensive.
3.  **Get Calibrated Audio:** The output is a new audio chunk that has been corrected. Its frequency response is now perfectly flat.
4.  **Process Further:** **All subsequent operations**—SAD (RMS/Flux), YAMNet inference, LUFS calculation, and file recording—are performed on this clean, calibrated audio chunk.

This ensures that every piece of data your application analyzes and saves is a scientifically accurate representation of the acoustic environment.

### Optional Step: Adjusting Filter Complexity for Performance

If you find that the real-time correction (`audio_device_calibrator.apply()`) is consuming too much CPU, especially on a resource-constrained device like a Raspberry Pi, you can reduce its computational load by adjusting the **number of filter taps** used during the design phase (Phase 2).

* **Locate:** Find the `_design_filter` method within your `AudioDeviceCalibrator` class.
* **Modify `num_taps`:** Change the value passed to `scipy.signal.firwin2`.
    * `num_taps=1024` (Default): High accuracy across all frequencies, high CPU load.
    * `num_taps=512`: Nearly half the CPU load, but with reduced accuracy, **especially in the critical low-frequency range (20Hz-250Hz)**. This means your measurements of traffic rumble, HVAC hum, etc., will be less precise.
    * `num_taps=256`: Even lower CPU load, but significant loss of low-frequency accuracy.
* **Delete Cache:** After changing `num_taps`, you **must delete the cache file** (`filter_cache/fir_filter_taps.npy`) so the filter is redesigned and re-cached with the new complexity on the next run.

**Trade-off:** Reducing `num_taps` saves CPU but sacrifices the accuracy of your low-frequency measurements, which is one of the primary benefits of using a calibrated microphone. Use this optimization only if absolutely necessary due to performance limitations.

## 4. Other Related Applications

A calibrated microphone is a versatile tool for any serious audio work. Its applications extend far beyond noise monitoring:

* **Room Acoustics Measurement:** Using software like **REW (Room EQ Wizard)**, you can use the UMIK-1 to measure a room's frequency response, reverberation time (RT60), and identify problematic standing waves. This is essential for designing home theaters, recording studios, or any critical listening space.
* **Speaker and Audio System Calibration:** Used to fine-tune the equalizer of a home audio or car stereo system to compensate for the acoustic imperfections of the listening environment. Software like **Dirac Live** or **Audyssey** relies on this process.
* **Scientific and Industrial Measurement:** Used in research to measure and document sound levels with scientific precision, such as environmental noise impact studies, psychoacoustic research, or testing the noise output of manufactured products.
* **Recording Studio Reference:** While not a vocal microphone, it can be used to capture an accurate "snapshot" of a room's sound, helping engineers make better mixing decisions.
