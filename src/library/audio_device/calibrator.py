"""
Handles the loading of a microphone calibration file, designing a correction filter,
and providing methods to apply the filter and retrieve sensitivity data.

This class manages the frequency response correction for calibrated microphones like the UMIK-1.
It includes caching for the designed filter coefficients to optimize startup time.
